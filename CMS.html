        A course management system, also known as a learning management system (LMS), is a software application that facilitates the administration, delivery, and management of educational courses or training programs. It provides educators, instructors, and learners with a centralized platform to create, organize, and deliver course content, as well as track and assess student progress. Course management systems typically offer features such as course creation and organization, content management, communication tools, assessment and grading capabilities, and reporting functionalities. They enable instructors to upload course materials, create assignments, facilitate online discussions, deliver quizzes or exams, and provide feedback to students. Students, on the other hand, can access course materials, submit assignments, participate in discussions, take assessments, and view their grades. Course management systems enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of teaching and learning by providing a structured and interactive environment for educational activities, fostering collaboration, and simplifying administrative tasks.</p>
